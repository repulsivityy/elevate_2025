# Agent Tool Mapping

This document maps the conceptual, agent-agnostic actions used in the runbooks to the specific tool implementations available to the Cline agent. This serves as a reference for understanding how procedural steps are executed and can be used as a guide for adapting the runbooks to other automation agents.
