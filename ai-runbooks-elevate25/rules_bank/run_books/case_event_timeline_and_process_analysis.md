## Case Event Timeline & Process Analysis Workflow

Objective: Generate a detailed timeline of events for a specific SOAR case (`${CASE_ID}`), including the **full process execution chain** leading to the alerted activity. Classify relevant processes as legitimate, LOLBIN, or malicious using GTI enrichment. Optionally enrich with MITRE TACTICs and generate a markdown report summarizing the findings. Optionally convert the report to PDF and attempt to attach it to the SOAR case.

Uses Tools:

*   `secops-soar.get_case_full_details` (Provides initial context and alerts)
*   `secops-soar.list_events_by_alert`
*   **`secops-mcp.search_security_events` (Crucial for finding parent process launch events)**
*   `secops-soar.google_chronicle_list_events` (To get broader asset context)
*   `secops-soar.google_chronicle_get_rule_details` (Optional, for specific rule context)
*   `secops-soar.google_chronicle_get_detection_details` (Optional, for specific detection context)
*   `gti-mcp.get_file_report` (for process hash classification)
*   `secops-mcp.get_threat_intel` (for MITRE TACTIC mapping/general enrichment)
*   `siemplify_create_gemini_case_summary` (Optional, for AI-generated summary)
*   **Action:** Generate report file (e.g., using `write_to_file`)
*   **Action:** Execute local command (e.g., using `execute_command` for `pandoc`)
*   `secops-soar.post_case_comment` (to note report location/attach if possible)
*   **Action:** Request user input (e.g., using `ask_followup_question`)
*   **Action:** Conclude runbook (e.g., using `attempt_completion`)
*   *(Optional SOAR Actions based on user confirmation):* `siemplify_case_tag`, `siemplify_change_priority`, `siemplify_add_general_insight`, `siemplify_update_case_description`, `siemplify_assign_case`, `siemplify_raise_incident`, `siemplify_create_gemini_case_summary`

**Workflow Steps & Diagram:**

1.  Get full case details (including alerts and comments) for `${CASE_ID}` using `get_case_full_details`.
2.  For each alert obtained in Step 1, list the associated events using `list_events_by_alert`.
3.  (Optional) If alert/event data contains specific Chronicle Rule IDs or Detection IDs, use `google_chronicle_get_rule_details` or `google_chronicle_get_detection_details` for more context.
4.  Extract key process information (PID, Parent PID, Hash, Path, CmdLine) and involved assets (Hostnames, IPs) from the events obtained in Step 2.
5.  **CRITICAL STEP: Find Parent Process Chain:** Iteratively search for `PROCESS_LAUNCH` events to trace the parent process chain backward from the initial alert events.
    *   **Start:** Identify the parent process PID (or `productSpecificProcessId`) from the initial alert events (Step 2). Let this be `Current_Parent_PID`. Identify the timestamp of the *child* process launch (`Child_Timestamp`).
    *   **Iterate:**
        *   Search SIEM (`secops-mcp.search_security_events`) for `PROCESS_LAUNCH` events where the *target* process PID matches `Current_Parent_PID`.
        *   **Time Window:** Use a focused time window around `Child_Timestamp` (e.g., +/- 15 minutes or +/- 1 hour).
        *   **Identifiers:** Attempt searches using both the principal hostname (if known) and principal IP address associated with the child process.
        *   **Store:** If the launch event for `Current_Parent_PID` is found, store its details (parent PID, command line, timestamp, etc.) in the process chain data. Update `Current_Parent_PID` to the *newly found parent's PID* and update `Child_Timestamp` to the timestamp of the event just found. Repeat the search.
        *   **Stop:** Continue iterating backward until a known root process (e.g., `explorer.exe`, `services.exe`) is reached, the parent PID is null/invalid, or the search yields no results within a reasonable timeframe.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** If `search_security_events` fails, times out, or returns no results:
        *   Try broadening the time window for the specific parent search (e.g., +/- 1 hour, +/- 6 hours). Be aware this may increase noise.
        *   Consider using `secops-soar.google_chronicle_list_events` filtered for `metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH"` on the specific asset around the expected time as an alternative.
        *   If parent process launch events are still elusive, consider searching for other related activity (e.g., user logins, network connections) associated with the parent process around its estimated start time to infer context.
        *   **Acknowledge Limitations:** Note that tracing the full chain might not always be possible due to log availability, timing discrepancies, unusual process IDs (e.g., PID 4), or processes starting before the log retention/search window.
    *   Store all found launch event details chronologically.
6.  (Optional) For key involved assets identified in Step 4, use `google_chronicle_list_events` to get broader event context for those assets around the alert time.
7.  Enrich process hashes using GTI (`get_file_report`) to classify processes (Legitimate, LOLBIN, Malicious).
8.  (Optional) Enrich activities with potential MITRE TACTICs using `get_threat_intel`.
9.  Synthesize the collected data (case details, alert events, parent process events, asset events, enrichments), sorting events chronologically.
10. (Optional) Generate an AI summary using `siemplify_create_gemini_case_summary`.
11. Format the report in Markdown, ensuring it **MUST** include:
    *   A summary section (incorporating initial case details and optionally the Gemini summary).
    *   A **Process Execution Tree (Text)** showing the parent-child chain *as determined*. If the full chain could not be traced, clearly indicate where the tracing stopped (e.g., `[PID ???]`).
    *   A **Process Execution Tree (Diagram)** using Mermaid (`graph LR`), similarly reflecting the extent of the traced chain.
    *   An **Event Timeline Table** including timestamps, classifications, and optional MITRE TACTICs/time deltas.
    *   An analysis section.
    *   *(Report Limitation Note):* If the full process chain could not be determined, explicitly state this limitation in the report summary or analysis section.
12. **Request user input** to confirm report generation and format preferences (e.g., include time delta, include Gemini summary).
13. **Generate report file** with the Markdown content in a timestamped file (e.g., `./reports/case_${CASE_ID}_timeline_${timestamp}.md`).
14. (Optional, based on user feedback) **Execute local command** to convert the Markdown report to PDF (e.g., using `pandoc`).
15. (Optional, based on user feedback) Attempt to attach the PDF to the SOAR case. *Note: Direct PDF attachment might require specific SOAR tools not always available. If attachment fails, post a comment with the local path to the MD/PDF report.*
16. (Optional, based on user feedback) **Request user input** to confirm if they want to perform additional SOAR actions (tagging, priority change, insight, description update, assignment, incident declaration).
17. (Optional, based on user feedback) Execute selected SOAR actions.
18. **Conclude runbook**:
    *   **Action:** Generate a Mermaid sequence diagram summarizing the specific actions taken during this execution.
    *   **Action:** Record the current date and time of execution.
    *   **Action:** (Optional) Record the token usage and runtime duration if available from the environment.
    *   Present the final summary.
