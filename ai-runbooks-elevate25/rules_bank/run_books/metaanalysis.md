# Runbook: Meta-Analysis

## Objective

To analyze trends, patterns, and correlations across multiple incidents, alerts, or hunts over a defined period to identify broader security issues, detection gaps, recurring threats, or systemic vulnerabilities. This runbook enables strategic analysis that informs security program improvements, threat landscape understanding, and resource allocation decisions.

## Scope

Focuses on analyzing aggregated data from SIEM, SOAR, threat intelligence, and security tools to identify macro-level patterns and trends. Includes statistical analysis, pattern recognition, and correlation analysis across large datasets. Covers multiple timeframes and data sources to provide comprehensive insights. Excludes deep investigation of individual events unless specifically relevant to identified patterns or trends. Does not include real-time analysis or operational incident response activities.

## Inputs

*   `${ANALYSIS_TIMEFRAME_DAYS}`: Lookback period for the analysis (e.g., 90, 180).
*   `${ANALYSIS_FOCUS}`: The specific area of focus (e.g., "Recurring False Positives for Rule X", "Common Malware Families Observed", "Lateral Movement Patterns", "Effectiveness of Phishing Response").
*   *(Optional) `${DATA_SOURCES}`: Specific SIEM queries, SOAR case filters, or other data sources to use.*

## Tools

*   `secops-soar`: `list_cases`, `get_case_full_details` (for analyzing case data)
*   `secops-mcp`: `search_security_events`, `get_security_alerts` (for analyzing event/alert data)
*   `bigquery`: `execute-query` (if analyzing data lake information)
*   **Action:** Generate report file (e.g., using `write_to_file`)
*   *(Potentially other tools for data aggregation or visualization if available)*

## Workflow Steps & Diagram

1.  **Define Scope & Objective:** Clearly define the `${ANALYSIS_FOCUS}` and `${ANALYSIS_TIMEFRAME_DAYS}`. Identify necessary `${DATA_SOURCES}`.
2.  **Data Collection:** Gather relevant data using specified tools (e.g., export case details, run broad SIEM/BigQuery queries).
3.  **Data Aggregation & Analysis:** Aggregate the collected data. Analyze for trends, patterns, outliers, and correlations related to the `${ANALYSIS_FOCUS}`.
4.  **Synthesize Findings:** Summarize the key findings and insights derived from the analysis.
5.  **Develop Recommendations:** Based on the findings, formulate actionable recommendations (e.g., tune specific detection rules, update runbooks, implement new security controls, focus threat hunting efforts).
6.  **Generate Report:** Create a comprehensive report detailing the analysis objective, methodology, data sources, findings, and recommendations using the "Generate report file" action. Include visualizations (e.g., Mermaid diagrams summarizing data flow or findings) if applicable.
7.  **Completion:**
    *   **Action:** Generate a Mermaid sequence diagram summarizing the specific actions taken during this execution.
    *   **Action:** Record the current date and time of execution.
    *   **Action:** (Optional) Record the token usage and runtime duration if available from the environment.
    *   Conclude the runbook execution.
