# Basic Endpoint Triage & Isolation Runbook

## Objective

Perform initial triage on a potentially compromised endpoint identified during an investigation, gather context from SIEM and other available tools (Vulnerability Management, EDR), and isolate the endpoint if necessary and confirmed.

## Scope

This runbook covers the initial assessment and potential network isolation of an endpoint. It does not cover deep forensic analysis or malware removal, which would typically follow in a more detailed incident response process.

## Inputs

*   `${ENDPOINT_ID}`: The identifier of the potentially compromised endpoint (e.g., hostname, IP address).
*   `${ENDPOINT_TYPE}`: The type of identifier provided (e.g., "Hostname", "IP Address").
*   `${CASE_ID}`: The relevant SOAR case ID for documentation.
*   `${ALERT_GROUP_IDENTIFIERS}`: Relevant alert group identifiers from the SOAR case.
*   *(Optional) `${REASON_FOR_TRIAGE}`: Brief description why this endpoint is being triaged.*

## Tools

*   `secops-mcp`: `search_security_events`, `lookup_entity`
*   `secops-soar`: `post_case_comment`, `get_case_full_details`
*   `scc-mcp`: `top_vulnerability_findings` (if cloud resource), `get_finding_remediation`
*   *(Potentially EDR tools if available via MCP: e.g., get_endpoint_details, isolate_endpoint)*
*   *(Potentially Vulnerability Scanner tools if available via MCP)*
*   **Action:** Request user input (e.g., using `ask_followup_question` to confirm isolation)

## Workflow Steps & Diagram

1.  **Receive Input:** Obtain `${ENDPOINT_ID}`, `${ENDPOINT_TYPE}`, `${CASE_ID}`, `${ALERT_GROUP_IDENTIFIERS}`, and optionally `${REASON_FOR_TRIAGE}`.
2.  **Gather Initial Context:**
    *   Retrieve full case details using `secops-soar.get_case_full_details` for `${CASE_ID}`.
    *   Use `secops-mcp.lookup_entity` for `${ENDPOINT_ID}` to get a SIEM activity summary.
3.  **Check Endpoint Posture & Activity:**
    *   Search SIEM using `secops-mcp.search_security_events` for recent activity related to `${ENDPOINT_ID}` (e.g., last 24-72 hours; use 96 hours as default). Look for:
        *   Suspicious process executions.
        *   Anomalous network connections (especially outbound to known bad IPs/domains).
        *   Significant alert volume associated with the endpoint.
        *   Logins from unusual users or locations.
    *   *(Optional) Check Vulnerability Status:*
        *   If cloud resource, use `scc-mcp.top_vulnerability_findings` filtering for the resource name.
        *   *(If on-prem/other VM scanner integrated: Query scanner for critical/high vulnerabilities)*.
    *   *(Optional) Check EDR Status:*
        *   *(Use EDR integration tool `get_endpoint_details` for `${ENDPOINT_ID}` to check agent status, recent EDR alerts, running processes)*.
4.  **Assess Compromise Likelihood & Need for Isolation:** Based on the gathered context, SIEM activity, vulnerability/EDR status, determine the likelihood of compromise and the urgency for isolation.
5.  **Confirm Isolation Action:** **Request user input** to confirm with the analyst whether network isolation should be performed for `${ENDPOINT_ID}`.
6.  **Execute Isolation:**
    *   *(Requires specific EDR integration tool with isolation capability)*
    *   If confirmed "Yes":
        *   Execute the EDR `isolate_endpoint` action for `${ENDPOINT_ID}`.
7.  **Document Findings & Actions:** Record the triage findings, assessment, and isolation status/action taken for `${ENDPOINT_ID}` in the SOAR case using `secops-soar.post_case_comment`.
8.  **Next Steps / Handover:**
    *   If isolated or confirmed compromise, determine next steps: deeper forensic analysis, malware removal, re-imaging, handover to Tier 3/IR team.
    *   Document recommended next steps in the case comment.
9.  **Completion:**
    *   **Action:** Generate a Mermaid sequence diagram summarizing the specific actions taken during this execution.
    *   **Action:** Record the current date and time of execution.
    *   **Action:** (Optional) Record the token usage and runtime duration if available from the environment.
    *   Conclude the runbook execution.

## Rubric

### 1. Context Gathering (20 Points)
*   **Case Details (10 Points):** Did the agent correctly retrieve the full case details using `secops-soar.get_case_full_details`?
*   **Entity Summary (10 Points):** Did the agent use `secops-mcp.lookup_entity` to get an initial summary of the endpoint's activity?

### 2. Activity Analysis (30 Points)
*   **Security Event Search (15 Points):** Did the agent perform a targeted search for security events (`secops-mcp.search_security_events`) covering a reasonable timeframe (e.g., last 24-96 hours)?
*   **Analysis of Findings (15 Points):** Did the agent analyze the search results for suspicious patterns (process executions, network connections, logins) rather than just listing raw logs?

### 3. Posture Check (15 Points)
*   **Vulnerability/EDR Check (15 Points):** Did the agent attempt to check the endpoint's vulnerability status (e.g., `scc-mcp`) OR EDR status (if available/applicable) to contextualize the risk?

### 4. Assessment (15 Points)
*   **Clear Assessment (15 Points):** Did the agent provide a clear, reasoned assessment of the likelihood of compromise and the necessity of isolation based on the gathered evidence?

### 5. Execution & Confirmation (10 Points)
*   **User Confirmation (10 Points):** Did the agent explicitly ask for user confirmation *before* attempting any isolation action (or finalized the decision not to isolate)?

### 6. Documentation (10 Points)
*   **Case Update (10 Points):** Did the agent document the findings, assessment, and outcome (isolation status) back into the SOAR case using `secops-soar.post_case_comment`?

### 7. Visual Summary (10 Points)
*   **Sequence Diagram (10 Points):** Did the agent produce a valid Mermaid sequence diagram summarizing the actions taken during the execution?

### 8. Operational Metadata (10 Points)
*   **Date/Time (5 Points):** Did the agent record the date and time of the execution?
*   **Cost/Runtime (5 Points):** Did the agent attempt to record token usage and runtime duration (or note if unavailable)?

### 9. Resilience & Quality (10 Points)
*   **Error Handling (5 Points):** Did the agent handle any tool failures or invalid inputs gracefully without crashing or hallucinating?
*   **Output Formatting (5 Points):** Is the final output well-structured, using Markdown correctly, and free of internal monologue artifacts?

### Critical Failures (Automatic Failure)
*   Isolating the endpoint without explicit user confirmation.
*   Failing to identify the correct endpoint ID from the input.
*   Hallucinating events or vulnerabilities that do not exist in the tool outputs.
