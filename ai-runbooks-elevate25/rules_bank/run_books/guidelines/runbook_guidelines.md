# Runbook Guidelines

This document provides general guidelines for creating, maintaining, and executing runbooks within this security environment.

## General Principles

*   **Clarity:** Runbooks should be clear, concise, and easy to follow, even under pressure.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure tool commands, parameters, and expected outcomes are accurate and up-to-date.
*   **Consistency:** Use consistent formatting, terminology, and structure across all runbooks.
*   **Actionability:** Focus on concrete steps and decisions analysts need to make.

## Agent-Agnostic Language

To ensure runbooks are portable and not tied to a specific agent's toolset, all steps should be described using conceptual, agent-agnostic actions rather than specific tool names. The executing agent is responsible for mapping these conceptual actions to its available tools.

| Conceptual Action | Example Agent Tool |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Generate report file** | `write_to_file` |
| **Request user input** | `ask_followup_question` |
| **Conclude runbook** | `attempt_completion` |
| **Execute local command** | `execute_command` |
| **Read file contents** | `read_file` |
| **Search file contents** | `search_files` |
| **List directory contents** | `list_files` |
| **Make targeted file edits** | `replace_in_file` |

When describing interactions with external platforms (like SIEM, SOAR, GTI), refer to the action being performed on the platform rather than the specific MCP tool call.

*   **Instead of:** "Use `secops-mcp.search_security_events`..."
*   **Prefer:** "Search the SIEM for..."

This approach ensures the procedural logic of the runbook remains independent of the implementation details of any single agent.

## Structure

Runbooks should generally include the following sections:

*   **Objective:** What is the goal of this runbook?
*   **Scope:** What is included and excluded from this procedure?
*   **Inputs:** What information is required to start the runbook (e.g., Case ID, IOC value, User ID)? Use `${VARIABLE_NAME}` format.
*   **Tools:** List the primary MCP tools required.
*   **Workflow Steps & Diagram:** Detail the sequence of actions. **Must** include a Mermaid sequence diagram visualizing the workflow that was *actually* performed, clearly showing interactions between the Analyst/Agent, MCP Servers (e.g., `secops-soar`, `gti-mcp`), and the specific conceptual actions or tools used (e.g., `list_cases`, `get_file_report`).
*   **Completion Criteria:** How is the successful completion of the runbook determined?

## Reporting Requirements

*   **Runbook Reference:** If a runbook execution results in a generated report (e.g., investigation summary, triage report), the report **must** clearly state which runbook was used at the beginning of the report.
    *   *Example:* `**Runbook Used:** Alert Investigation Summary Report Runbook`

## Maintenance

*   Runbooks should be reviewed periodically (e.g., quarterly) to ensure they remain accurate and relevant.
*   Update runbooks promptly when tools, procedures, or configurations change.

*(Add other specific guidelines as needed)*
